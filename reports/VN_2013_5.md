*******
### Test: dnsInjection
#### Description
For every domain in the input list we perform a A query towards the target IP address using UDP on port 53.

We wait for a DNS response until the timeout (by default 3 seconds) is reached.

If we have received an answer by that time we say that that hostname is being injected (since the endpoint is not a DNS resolver the answer we got must have been injected by the censorship middle boxes).

If we don't receive an answer that means everything is as usual and we mark that hostname as not being injected.
#### Possible conclusions
If DNS injection is being done and on which domains.
#### Results
* Test executed: 1456
* Test concluded with injection: 0 (0.00%)


* Max percentual of injection: 0.00%
	* Item:  - 0 over 0
* Min percentual of injection: 0.00%
	* Item: bkav.com.vn - 0 over 1
* Median percentual of injection: 0.00%


* Domains concluded always with injection: 0
* Domains concluded always without injection: 1456
